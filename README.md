# Visualization-in-R-Practice-1
This was my final submission to a test administered in my Data Science class. I explored a dataset summarizing job postings from various companies around the US. All of the job postings have something to do with data, and most of them are data science jobs. I completed this individually and without the use of any AI tools.

### 1. Top 10 Hiring Companies - plot_1

Create plot_1 to display the top 10 companies in the dataset in terms of the number of job postings listed. (Note that there are 4 ties for the 9th spot, so the tibble and the subsequent plot show 12 companies.)

### 2. Jobs By Title - plot_2

Create a plot to display a count of each of the simplified job titles in the dataset.

### 4. Top 10 Job Postings By Location - plot_4

Create a plot that displays the top 10 locations in the dataset in terms of the number of job postings associated with that location. (Note that there is a tie for the 10th spot, so there are 11 total locations.)

### 7. Salary Estimates By 10 Most Common Locations - plot_7

Create a plot to display the mean and median salaries by location, but only for the top 10 locations (in terms of number of postings, not in terms of salaries, which means there are 11 locations in the results because of the tie for 10th place).
